After meeting a beautiful angel-like detective girl, named Siesta in a hijacked plane, I became her assistant.<br/><br/>And from there–[You deal with the beehive, and I’ll restrain the enemy.] [Don’t make plans that make me the victim.]
            We had those kinds of foolish conversations, all while being completely broke every day and fought against . Even when there were hurricanes, the weather-beaten duo sleep past it. Sometimes when we saved money at a casino, we would jump around on the beds at a resort hotel, only to be broke again the next day. We would walk through deserts, traverse through jungles, conquer mountains, cross oceans– The great detective and her assistant would go through these dazzling adventures–Until she died.
            And this story starts from 1 year after that incident.I’m the only one who’s left, but I carry on her remained wishes.
